# Food-Delivery-App
This project is a full-stack food delivery platform built with python(flask), HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It simulates a real- world delivery system where users can: Register &amp; login securely to access their accounts. Browse restaurants and menu, adding items to a cart for checkout. Place and track orders in real time. 	Use a dashboard that displays order status and quick actions. The backend is powered by Flask + SQLAlchemy to manage users, orders, and tracking, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JS for a responsive and interactive user experience. This project demonstrates how to connect backend APIs with frontend logic, integrate user authentication, and implement live order trackingâ€”similar to real apps like DoorDash or UberEats.
